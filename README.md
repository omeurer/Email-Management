# Email-Management
This notebook automatizes the cleaning of your mailbox, and thus help to avoid gas emission by data storage.

The huge amount of mails we receive everyday is stored into servers. Email storing is thus reponsible of unnecessary gas emission. A great action that can be taken is to delete a lot of them. Nonetheless, if we do it by hand, we can't even select all the mails from a particular kind.

Email marketing and newletters are are great ways to target its clients. Nonetheless, when these email become outdated, one can delete them. 

With this notebook, you will be able to :

1. Store variables in your environment system to be not explicitly readable in your code (such as your email & password),
2. Know how to access your mailbox (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook) thanks to Python,
3. Store all your mail in a DataFrame (to get statistics, to know which sender is most frequent for example), 
4. Delete particular types of email according to different criteria, 
5. Get familiar with the time librairy. 

I am not an expert (yet ;),just a student who loves data, and is concerned by the 876389 mails he has in its mailbox. Some process can be optimized : feel free to suggesst anything !
